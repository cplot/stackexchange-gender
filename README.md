There has previously been drama about the percentage of women on various StackExchange websites (1,2).

Here, the top 100 users by karma of all StackExchange sites with more than 25k users were downloaded on 8 July 2014 and hand coded for gender (based on name, picture, website). Care was taken to code gender only when gender could be assessed with high confidence. Some individuals were counted multiple times if they were in the top 100 on several websites.

Across the top 100 users of all sites, 1640 were identified as men and 47 were identified as women (so, 2.8% of top users with known gender are women).
